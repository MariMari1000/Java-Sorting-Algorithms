<h1>Java Sorting Algorithms</h1>

<p>This repository contains a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Java, along with performance analysis for each algorithm. Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in computer science and are fundamental for tasks such as data organization, searching, and data analysis. This project aims to provide implementations of various sorting algorithms and analyze their performance characteristics under different scenarios.</p>

<h2>Implemented Sorting Algorithms</h2>

<p>The following sorting algorithms are implemented and included in this project:</p>

<h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
<p>Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Despite its simplicity, Bubble Sort is relatively inefficient and is primarily used for educational purposes or for sorting small datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity.</p>

<h3>Merge Sort</h3>
<p>Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves. Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases and is known for its stability and efficiency, making it suitable for large datasets.</p>

<h3>Counting Sort</h3>
<p>Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based integer sorting algorithm that works by determining the number of occurrences of each unique element in the input array and using arithmetic to calculate the position of each element in the output sequence. Counting Sort has a linear time complexity of O(n + k), where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the range of the input.</p>

<h3>Selection Sort</h3>
<p>Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moves it to the beginning. Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is straightforward to implement, but it is not efficient for large datasets.</p>

<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
<p>Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array. Insertion Sort has an average time complexity of O(n^2), but it performs well for small datasets and nearly sorted arrays.</p>

<h2>Running the Project</h2>

<ol>
<li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
<li>Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <code>Main</code> class in the <code>MainMethod</code> package.</li>
<li>Run the <code>main</code> method to execute the sorting algorithms and measure their performance.</li>
<li>View the console output to see the average runtime of each sorting algorithm for different array sizes.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Performance Measurement</h2>

<p>The project measures the average runtime of each sorting algorithm for randomly generated arrays of different sizes. It runs each sorting algorithm multiple times for each array size and calculates the average runtime. This allows for a detailed analysis of the efficiency and scalability of each sorting algorithm under various conditions.</p>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>ArrayUtil</code> class in the <code>util</code> package provides a method to generate random arrays for testing the sorting algorithms.</li>
<li>Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its respective class within the <code>algorithms</code> package.</li>
<li>References to external sources are provided within each sorting algorithm class for further reading and understanding.</li>
    </ul>
